              question: "How long does a typical project take?",
              answer: "Most brochure-style sites launch in 4–6 weeks. More complex builds with custom integrations can run 8–10 weeks. We map timelines in the proposal so you know what to expect."
            },
            {
              question: "Do you really hand-code every website?",
              answer: "Yes. We start with wireframes, move into design, then code everything in HTML/CSS/JS. No WordPress, no page builders. It keeps your site lean, fast, and secure."
            },
            {
              question: "What’s included in the $175/mo plan?",
              answer: "You get design, development, hosting, SSL, unlimited edits, analytics setup, and proactive maintenance. It’s the easiest way to keep your site running without hiring in-house."
            },
            {
              question: "Can I cancel the monthly plan?",
              answer: "There’s a 12-month agreement to cover the initial build. After that, you can move to a maintenance-only plan, continue as-is, or switch to an on-demand engagement."
            },
            {
              question: "What if I already have a website?",
              answer: "We’ll audit what you’ve got, figure out what’s working, and rebuild the rest from the ground up. Most clients see improved load times, better conversions, and happier visitors."
            },
            {
              question: "Do you offer SEO or Google Ads support?",
              answer: "Absolutely. We bake in on-page SEO during development and can manage ongoing SEO + Google Ads campaigns so your site actually gets traffic."
            },
            {
              question: "Will I be able to make updates after launch?",
              answer: "Yes—send edits over and we take care of them. If you want to handle updates yourself, we’ll provide documentation or lightweight CMS options to keep things moving."
            },
            {
              question: "How many pages are included?",
              answer: "Most starter sites include up to five fully designed pages. Need more? We’ll scope additional pages or landing pages as part of the proposal so pricing stays transparent."
            },
            {
              question: "What content do I need to provide?",
              answer: "We can work from your existing copy or collaborate on messaging. We’ll guide you on photography, brand voice, and key selling points to make sure every page resonates."
            },
            {
              question: "Do you work with businesses outside Dallas?",
              answer: "Yes—we partner with clients across the U.S. and Canada. Everything can be handled via Zoom, Loom, and shared project spaces so distance is never a blocker."
